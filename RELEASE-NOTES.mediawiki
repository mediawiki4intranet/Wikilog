== Mediawiki4Intranet's Wikilog 2.0 ==

* Support for PostgreSQL
* Support for MediaWiki up to 1.26
* Several bug fixes

== Mediawiki4Intranet's Wikilog as of 2015-01-21 ==

Our Wikilog version is heavily improved; there is a lot of new big features:

* «Forum» view — i.e. sorting of entries by the date of last comment in «archives» mode, and unread comment count tracking
*: Add link to <your_wiki>/Special:Wikilog?view=archives&show=published&sort=wlp_talk_updated&desc=1 in your MediaWiki:Sidebar with «WikiForum» title to get a forum view
* (!) Wikilog-style hierarchical talk support for normal pages, not just for the blogs
* Comment email notifications
* New blog entry email notifications (subscribe by watching main page of the blog)
* RSS/Atom comment feeds
* Subscribing/unsubscribing to all comments in a blog, or even in all blogs in a wiki (the last is a user preference)
* New post creation form on Special:Wikilog (in the «blog agregator»)
* Exclusion of blogs and posts in specific category from the aggregated view ($wgWikilogDefaultNotCategory)
* Drop-down lists for wikilog/author/category fields on Special:Wikilog
* Post calendar for MediaWiki:Sidebar
*: Add «* wikilogcalendar» to MediaWiki:Sidebar to enable it
* Automatic folding of non-branching comments to the linear view — this prevents too many nesting levels without any loss of hierarchy
* Improved binary encoding of materialized paths to comments, allowing to store up to 250 nesting levels, versus 36 in old Wikilog
* Pagination which never breaks discussion threads
* Thread/list view switching for comments
* Experimental support for importing dumps from blogger.com
* Various bug fixes

The localisation was of course broken in the meantime — there is full support only for English and Russian :)

== Wikilog 1.1.0 ==

Aug 8, 2010

=== General notes ===

Database schema changed since 1.0.x, a database update is required.
You should backup your data and run maintenance/update.php to upgrade.

MediaWiki requirement raised to 1.15.0 and later. MediaWiki 1.14 and earlier
are no longer supported in this release, stick with Wikilog 1.0.x if this is
your case.

=== New configuration options ===

* $wgWikilogExtSummaries: use of categories and tags parameters in summary entry header and footer messages.
* $wgWikilogExpensiveLimit: configures how many items to show on pages that includes other pages (expensive requests that may demand article parsing). Replaces $wgWikilogSummaryLimit.
* $wgWikilogNumComments: default number of comments to show at once on discussion pages.

=== New features ===

* Messages wikilog-item-brief-header/footer, wikilog-item-header/footer and others replaced by wikilog-summary-header/footer, wikilog-entry-header/footer and others, with better support for plural and gender inflection, separate date and time, and also support to category and tag lists.
* (wl:issue 2) Improved article summary extraction. Now a "--more--" marker alone in a line breaks the summary (above) from the rest of the article (below). The <summary> tag has precedence over this new marker. If neither is found, the first section is used.
* Improved customization of article comments pages. Now, comment headers and footers are can be configured through messages wikilog-comment-header/ footer and others.
* More user-friendly navigation bars. Currently, they only have first, last, previous and next links. Support for other MediaWiki features, like items-per-page will come later.
* Discussion pages are now paged, i.e., only a maximum number of comments (default 50) are shown at once, with paging links to visit other pages of comments.
* Comment syndication feeds are now available. Currently, there is one feed per wikilog article, that lists comments made to that article. In the future, feeds per thread, per wikilog and global may be provided.
* Added support for MediaWiki 1.16 Vector skin.
* Special:Wikilog now allows querying by namespace, with the "Namespace:*" syntax.

=== Bug fixes ===

* (mw:bug 21657) Message wikilog-item-brief-header/footer replaced by wikilog-summary-header/footer and others, with proper PLURAL support.
* (wl:issue 1) Improve header/footer item messages.
* (wl:issue 5) Usability improvement in wikilog actions tab.
* (mw:bug 21916) Fix minimum feed cache age check in WikilogFeed. Noted by Vitaliy Filippov.
* Don't croak in Wikilog::getWikilogInfo() if $title is NULL. Patch by Vitaliy Filippov.
* Improved consistency of edit links with the rest of MediaWiki.
* (wl:issue 7) Handle the new Vector skin hooks (Mw 1.16).
